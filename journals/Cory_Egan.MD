Brainstorming session with all group members on idea for the project.
Presented our final idea to instructors including our Excalidraw from our brainstorming session with our MVP in mind.
Next we worked on our Collaboration Contract which included:
Each members strengths and weaknesses
How we would assign tasks and track them through our shared git lab repository
Our plan to incorporate daily standup meetings
Also came up with a name for our project "Truth in Tech"
Cloned a Git Lab repository that had been made from Galvanize program, added team members and made sure each
member had their docker containers running.
We completed our Wireframe and attached it to our project in GitLab.
As a group came up with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to complete during our project.
Discussed our API Endpoints and came up with a list of endpoints and JSON Response for each.
